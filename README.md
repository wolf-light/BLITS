# BLAZE

So, I got the software from the previous Avionics lead, and it's pretty cool. Its base functionality seems to be pretty much complete, but I will hook it up to our current system soon to make sure data collection works as it should. Assuming it does work as it should, we have a great starting point to work with. If you want to take a look at the current Python files, you absolutely can. I'll try and get a meeting set within the next few weeks so that I can show you guys the software so far, and we'll brainstorm any improvements that should be made. But if you know Python, you're more than welcome to look over/run the files and try to make sense of it. This software's main job is going to be collecting and storing the data input from all 3 systems (check the PCB design thread for more info on what that means), and hopefully uploading it to our Firebase hosted website.
